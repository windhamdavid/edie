				<p>EDIE was established as a nonprofit organization in 1996 and approved by the IRS as a tax-exempt charity under Section 501(c)(3). EDIE has no commercial or government ties. Its sole mission is to encourage and enable educators <i>to base more of their decisions on scientific evidence</i>. Far too many educational decisions are based on<i> personal bias, political agendas, antiquated regulations, and compelling sales pitches</i>. There is much more evidence available for educational decision-making than is presently used. <i>EDIE amasses, integrates, and interprets the evidence and publishes it in easy-to-understand language for the benefit of educators and others involved in education.</i></p>

				<p><b>The Handbook on Effective Instructional Strategies,</b> published in 1998, was our first effort to bridge the gap between research and practice. It describes 15 effective instructional strategies and presents from 50 to over 200 research studies to confirm the efficacy of each strategy in enhancing academic achievement. Commonly used instructional strategies that research shows do not work are also described.</p>

				<p>In addition to making evidence available, the Institute makes every effort to facilitate its application to improve educational practice. Toward this end a companion Instructor's Manual and Student Guide were prepared for the Handbook to facilitate its adoption and use as a textbook for workshops and courses in pre-service and in-service teacher education. College courses are offered to teach the 15 effective instructional strategies to practicing and aspiring teachers.</p>

				<p>A second resource book, <b>Ensuring Student Success,</b> was published in 2000. It too bridges the gap between research and practice by describing educational practices shown by research to be <i>effective in maximizing student success in school</i>. Much more can be done to reduce the large number of our youth who fail to receive a high school education.</p>

				<p>Our third resource book, <b>Educators' Handbook on Effective Testing,</b> was published early in 2003. It provides guidance educators need to satisfy the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/nclb/landing.jhtml">No Child Left Behind Act</a> and state accountability laws. This Handbook includes evaluations of many tests used extensively in education and guidelines that show educators <i>how to select, construct, and defend the tests they use</i>.</p>

				<p>Our fourth resource book, <b>No School Left Behind: How to Increase Student Achievement,</b> was published in 2005. It is written for parents and other citizens involved in education. The book summarizes in plain English educational practices shown by research to work. <i>&quot;After reading your publication parents and others will have a good understanding of what makes schools effective&quot;:</i> <b>Dr. Anne Bryant, Executive Director, National School Boards Association.</b> <i>&quot;Friedman backs up his advice with research and offers parents and teachers simple, sound advice on helping children to learn&quot;:</i> <b>Vanessa Bush, </b>for<b> <i>Booklist</i>, American Library Association.</b></p>

				<p>Our fifth resource book, <b>Effective Instruction: A Handbook of Evidence-Based Strategies</b> was published in 2006 to update, expand, improve, and replace the Handbook on Effective Instructional Strategies. It describes instructional practices shown by research to work, as well as commonly used practices proven not to work  <i>&quot;I believe the book should be very beneficial to administrators and staff development personnel.  It pulls together in one place all the instructional strategies that are supported by research evidence.&quot; </i> <b>Robert Stevens, Ph. D., Associate Professor of Educational Psychology, Penn State University.</b><BR>

				<p>Education benefits every time evidence from our resource books is used to make decisions.</p>
