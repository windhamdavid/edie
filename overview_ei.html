						<p>Effective Instruction is unlike the usual <i>&quot;tips for teachers&quot;</i> books that quote experts and studies selected to support the author&#146;s bias.  It is a 840-page resource book that describes in plain English 21 instructional strategies proven to significantly improve student achievement.  From 66 to over 550 research studies are cited to document the effectiveness of each strategy.  Research results are clearly presented and referenced in detail so that anyone can verify the conclusions.  The strategies are classroom tested.  They can be readily incorporated in classroom instruction as well as in pre-service and in-service teacher education programs.  In addition, commonly used strategies proven not to work are exposed in the book.</p>
	<p>Distilled from thousands of research studies amassed over the last decade <u>Effective Instruction</u> meets the demands of the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/nclb/landing.jhtml">No Child Left Behind Act</a> for instruction to be based on solid evidence instead of personal opinion, political agendas, or compelling sales pitches.</p>
							</font></p>
	The Easy-to-Use Format<br>
	The evaluation of each strategy follows the same consistent format.  The purpose is to make each description simple to read, understand, and implement.
