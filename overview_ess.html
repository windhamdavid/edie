					&quot;Ensuring Student Success</B> provides an excellent resource to educators serving
								in every role. Even non-educators who want to devote energy to improving student
								achievement will find this book to be a thoughtful read. Myles I. Friedman's approach
								satisfies the logical, rational and sequential thinker. His work is founded on solid
								scientific reasoning for decision making in education. The logical writing sequence
								serves to define issues and problems followed by an analysis of them. Friedman, a
								retired education professor in South Carolina, describes necessary interventions,
								which include corrective tutoring, effective instructional strategies and empowering
								students with strategies for self-teaching.&quot;</i><BR>
								<BR>
								<i>&quot;The work concludes with information on preventing impediments to learning,
								the benefit of effective preschool instruction and the benefit of teaching students
								to innovate. Friedman offers a comprehensive approach to improved learning. The book
								delves into key issues facing all citizens and professionals. School violence, teaching
								techniques, class size, disruptions and ability grouping are included among the factors
								affecting student learning and school culture. The book belongs on the reading list
								of conscientious citizens and educators interested in research and data - driven
								reform. My copy has become a regular reference source.&quot; - </i><B>Joseph W. Rudnicki,
								Superintendent, Sunnyvale School District, Sunnyvale, California</B> <BR>
								<BR>
								<i>&quot;The chapters describing how to change practice in accordance with evidence
								are great. I like the book because it puts a fresh and refreshing spin on the goal
								of student improvement: increasing student success, especially defined as increasing
								the number of students who master high school objectives.&quot; </i>- <B>Dr. Lawrence
								Lezotte, school improvement leader. Head of Effective Schools Ltd.</B> <B>Former
								Chair, Department of Educational Administration, Michigan State University</B><BR>
								<BR>
								<i>&quot;The book seems relevant and a useful guide for decision-making. I think
								you have attempted a bold and complex task in drawing together large bodies of work
								to address the problem of enhancing student success in school.&quot;</i> -<B> Dr.
								Carolyn Evertson, Peabody College, Vanderbilt University <BR>
								<BR>
								</B><i>&quot;Discussing how American values can stand in the way of successful schools
								is a novel and effective approach... I concur completely with your premise that the
								only way to ensure student success is to implement educational practice that research
								shows to be effective.&quot;</i> - <B>John Anderson, Vice Chairman of New American
								Schools </B><BR>
								<BR>
								<i>&quot;Friedman has done us a service.&quot;</i>- <B>Arnold F. Fege, President/
								Public Advocacy for Kids </B><BR>
								<BR>
								<i>&quot;...Friedman has a plan to fix American education. Our present system allows
								far too many student deficiencies, he contends, which contribute to a multitude of
								social ills. His solution is to improve teaching effectiveness. He thus advocates
								corrective instruction by individualized attention, with teachers evaluating students
								according to whether they have achieved &quot;mastery&quot; or &quot;not yet&quot;...&quot;
								<BR>
								<BR>
								&quot;According to this method, advancement would only follow mastery, and teachers
								would have the authority to make educational decisions based on research evidence.
								Prescriptive teaching strategies and tactics cover a wide range of recommendations,
								including instructional expectations, evaluations, and keeping students on task....&quot;<BR>
								<BR>
								&quot;Friedman is critical of current thinking on student discipline, ability grouping,
								and whole language instruction and supports his arguments with extensive bibliographic
								references. Some points are belabored, but overall effort is provocative and worth
								consideration by educators, parents, school boards, and citizens in general. Recommended
								despite the high price.&quot;</i> - <B>Will Hepfer, SUNY at Buffalo, Library Journal,
								January 2001.</B>
